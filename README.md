# HudDental

The combined application is under the "Combined" folder. Download this so you can see how to add new components with what already works (mainly to link with the login page).
Look under the "Resources" folder for stuff like the blank GUI template that we're all using, or the MySQL examples.

## Features that currently work:
* Staff can login
* Dentists and nurses can view their schedule
* Receptionists can make bookings and register new patients
* Receptionists can view/modify a patient's existing appointments
* Patient's can view their booked appointments
