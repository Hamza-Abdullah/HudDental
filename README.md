## Note: The database has been disabled as of May, and so the application will not function with its current configuration. This could always be rectified, by configuring it to use your own database.

The combined application is under the "Combined" folder. Download this so you can see how to add new components with what already works (mainly to link with the login page).
Look under the "Resources" folder for stuff like the blank GUI template that we're all using, or the MySQL examples.

## Features that currently work:
* Staff can login (Chris and Hamza)
* Patients can login (Chris and Hamza)
* Patients can view notifications for their newly booked appointments (Chris)
* Dentists and nurses can view their schedule with relevant details pertaining to each appointment (Danyal)
* Receptionists can make bookings and register new patients (Hamza)

* A user can view/edit their details (Hamza)
* All staff can request leave (Chris and Danyal)
* A manager can view statistics, and approve or deny holiday requests (Danyal)
* All users can logout and are taken back to the login screen. They can login again if needed.
